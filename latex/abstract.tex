\section*{Abstract}
The Model Independent Search in CMS (MUSiC) analyzes large amounts of LHC data by comparing kinematic distributions of the measured events to standard model predictions made by Monte Carlo simulations. Different from conventional dedicated analyses, MUSiC does not only focus on one or a few decay channels but covers a broad spectrum of final states which is processed. 
The comparison algorithm is very computation intensive
