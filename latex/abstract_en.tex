\chapter*{Abstract}
The Model Unspecific Search in CMS (MUSiC) analyzes large amounts of LHC data by comparing kinematic distributions of the measured events to standard model predictions made by Monte Carlo simulations. Different from conventional dedicated analyses, MUSiC does not only focus on one or a few decay channels but covers a broad spectrum of final states which is considered. 
The calculation of the most significant deviations in the kinematic distributions is very computation intensive. This work features an additional selection step which significantly improves computation performance while keeping the same physical results: before the calculation of a complex integral, a simpler term is evaluated to estimate the significance of a certain region. The performance gain with this procedure is about \unit{XYZ}{\%} and will enable the MUSiC-group to perform more accurate analyses in the future.
