\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Units}
Throughout this work, a natural unit system will be used, as it is convention in high energy particle physics. The speed of light and the reduced Planck constant are fixed to $c = 1$ and $\hbar = 1$, and as such they are omitted in equations. Additionally, energy is expressed in \si{\GeV}, where \SI{1}{\GeV} is the energy gain of an electron which is accelerated across a \SI{1}{\giga\volt} potential ($\SI{1}{\eV} \approx \SI{1.602e-19}{\joule}$). These conventions induce a change in units for the other dimensions, most importantly mass and momentum, both of which are notated in \si{\GeV}. Benefits of this choice of units are simpler equations, the possibility of a direct comparison between energy and masses, and typical quantities of $\order{\SI{1}{\GeV}}$.

\section{The Standard Model}
The \emph{standard model} (SM) is a theory that represents our current knowledge of elementary particles, their forces and interactions, excluding gravity. 

Particles in the standard model can be classified into two separate classes: \emph{Fermions}, which make up matter and possess a spin of $\nicefrac{1}{2}$, and \emph{bosons}, which are mediators of forces and possess an integer spin.
Three elementary forces arise, each from their separate theory: \emph{electrodynamic} (described by Quantum Electrodynamics, QED), \emph{strong} (described by Quantum Chromo Dynamics, QCD) and \emph{weak} (described by Quantum Flavor Dynamics). The forces are induced by corresponding charge-like properties: electrodynamic charge, color charge and weak isospin. These charges can then be used to further subdivide fermions into \emph{quarks} and \emph{leptons}, which will be described in the following sections. 

The standard model also provides theoretical predictions about the relations between particles, their masses and the probabilities of certain processes to happen. Because the probability is proportional to the number of times that a process occurs, experimentalists can validate the standard model by counting events with certain outcomes.

\subsection{Leptons}
There are three charged leptons: the \emph{electron} (\Pe), the \emph{muon} (\Pmu) and the \emph{tau} (\Ptau). They carry the electric charge of \SI{-1}{e} and participate in electrodynamic and weak interactions. For each charged lepton, there is one \emph{neutrino} counterpart (\Pnue, \Pnum, \Pnut). Neutrinos are electrically neutral, weakly interacting, massless particles. They remain undetected in current collider detectors.
The leptons do not carry color charge and are thus excluded from the strong interaction.
An overview about the leptons and their masses can be found in table~\ref{tbl:sm_leptons}.

\subsection{Quarks}
Similarly to the leptons, quarks can be divided into three generations. The first generation contains the stable \emph{up} and \emph{down} quarks, the second generation the \emph{charm} and \emph{strange} quarks and the third generation contains the heavy \emph{top} and \emph{bottom} quarks. Quarks carry a fractional electric charge of either $\nicefrac{2}{3} \si{\elementarycharge}$ or $\nicefrac{-1}{3} \si{\elementarycharge}$.
They also carry color charges and take part in the strong interaction as well as in the weak interaction.
The three quark generations and their properties are shown in table~\ref{tbl:sm_quarks}.

\end{table}

\subsection{Bosons}
Gauge bosons are mediators of the elementary forces. The electromagnetic force is mediated by the massless \emph{photon} (\Pphoton), the strong force by the massless \emph{gluon} (\Pgluon) and the weak force by the massive \PZ and \PWpm bosons. They couple to the corresponding charges. To account for the massive boson masses, the Higgs mechanism is introduced. The Higgs field gives rise to the Higgs boson (\PHiggs), for which a candidate has been found in 2012\cite{Ao2015Combined}.
All bosons and their properties are listed in table \ref{tbl:sm_bosons}.

\end{table}

\subsection{Antiparticles}
For each SM particle, there exists one counterpart with the same mass but an opposite sign for all charge-like properties, called \emph{antiparticle}. Unlike fermions, bosons are their own antiparticles, called Majorana particles.

\subsection{Ranges}
While the electrodynamic and weak couplings decrease with increasing distance, the strong force only grows stronger with a larger distance. This gives rise to the phenomenon of \emph{quark confinement}: as two quarks are separated from each other, new quark-antiquark pairs are created from the energy in between. Because of this, outgoing quarks with high energies form \emph{jets} consisting of hadrons from newly created quarks.

\section{The Large Hadron Collider}
Elementary particles and the standard model are commonly studied using scattering experiments. Such an experiment can be separated into two basic parts: an \emph{accelerator} and a \emph{detector}.
Inside the accelerator, the particles are accelerated to high energies using an electric field. They collide with their target inside the detector, which records various properties of the deflected or created particles, such as direction, momentum and energy. 
One can either accelerate particles on a straight line (\emph{linear accelerator}) or on a circular trajectory (\emph{ring}) which is enforced by dipole magnets. The latter option allows for longer acceleration time but is limited by the emission of Bremsstrahlung.
There are also two options for the collision. Either a \emph{fixed target} can be irradiated or two accelerated particle beams can be brought to collision (\emph{collider}). Because of kinematic reasons, a collider experiment can achieve higher energies.

The \emph{Large Hadron Collider} (LHC) is a proton-proton ring collider experiment of the European Organization for Nuclear Research (\emph{Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire}, CERN), situated between \SI{45}{\meter} and \SI{170}{\meter} underground near Geneva, Switzerland. The LHC has been installed in the tunnel of the former Large Electron Proton Collider (LEP), having a circumference of \SI{26.7}{\kilo\meter}\cite{BV2009CERN,EB2008LHC}. The two proton beams are injected into the LHC after passing a series of preaccelerators, as shown in figure \ref{fig:cern_accelerator_complex}. It has been designed to provide an energy of \SI{7}{\TeV} per beam, resulting in a center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s} = \SI{14}{\TeV}$. It is currently (2015) running at $\sqrt{s} = \SI{13}{\TeV}$, the data analyzed in this work were taken in 2012 at $\sqrt{s} = \SI{8}{\TeV}$ with a total integrated luminosity of \SI{19.7}{\femto\barn^{-1}} \cite{DHK+2014MUSiC}.

\section{The Compact Muon Solenoid Detector}
The Compact Muon Solenoid Detector (CMS) is an experiment at the LHC. The CMS detector\cite{Co2008CMS} consist of a barrel section along the beam pipe, which is closed off by two end caps. Collisions happen in the center of the barrel at the interaction point. 
The detector parts and particle footprints can be found in figure \ref{fig:cms_slice}.
Close to the \emph{interaction point}, the inner part of the barrel contains a \emph{silicon tracker} used to record trajectories of charged particles. 
The inner tracker is surrounded by an \emph{electromagnetic calorimeter} (ECAL) made of lead tungstate crystals. The ECAL measures energy deposited by electrons and photons, combined with the tracker it can distinguish between the two particle types. 
After the electromagnetic calorimeter follows the \emph{hadron calorimeter} (HCAL). It is a sampling calorimeter composed of layers of brass absorber plates and plastic scintillator fibers. Due to the high density of the brass absorbers, hadronic showers deposit most of their energy inside the HCAL.
The HCAL is surrounded by the most important feature of the CMS detector, the \emph{solenoid magnet}. The solenoid coil is cooled down below \SI{10}{\kelvin}, where the NbTi (Niobium-Titanium) conductor becomes superconducting, allowing for currents up to \SI{19}{\kilo\ampere}. The resulting field strength in the center of the coil is \SI{4}{\tesla}. The strong magnetic field causes the charged particle tracks to bend, this effect is used to measure the momentum of charged particles.
In the outer part one finds the iron return yoke interspersed with \emph{muon drift chambers}, \emph{cathode strip chambers} and \emph{resistive plate chambers}. Since only muons and neutrinos pass through the solenoid and iron yoke and neutrinos remain undetected, the drift chambers can precisely identify muons and assess their momentum.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Coordinate System}
The CMS collaboration has defined a spherical coordinate system inside the detector, as illustrated in figure \ref{fig:cms_coordinate_system}. The origin is located in the interaction point, the z-axis points along the beam pipe towards the Jura mountains. The x-axis is defined towards the center of the LHC ring. To complete the right-handed orthogonal coordinate system, the y-axis points upwards, orthogonally from the x-z-plane. 
An azimuthal angle $\phi$ is defined from the x-axis in the x-y plane. The polar angle $\theta$ is measured from the z-axis. One can also define a radial coordinate $r$ in the x-y plane, as distance from the z-axis.\cite[p. 2]{Co2008CMS}

\section{Commonly Used Quantities}
The proton is a composite particle consisting of quarks and gluons, which each carry an unknown momentum fraction. Because a collision can only occur between these constituents, the initial momentum sum along the z-axis is unknown.
Thus, most of the kinetic variables are defined in the transverse (x-y) plane. A particle is assigned a \emph{transverse momentum} \pT which only contains the transverse component of its momentum vector. Analogous, only a fraction of the energy is regarded, the \emph{transverse energy} \ET. 
The sum of all transverse momenta in a final state is usually not equals to zero since invisible neutrinos carry away some of the momentum. This is accounted for by the negative sum of the transverse energy, which is called \emph{missing transverse energy} \MET.
Another commonly used quantity is the pseudo-rapidity $\eta = -\ln \tan(\theta/2)$, which has the property that distances $\Delta\eta$ are Lorentz invariant.

\section{Bunch Crossings, Events, Collisions and Pileup}
For acceleration purposes, the protons circulating in the LHC beam pipe are grouped into 2808 \emph{bunches}\cite[p.4]{EB2008LHC}. A \emph{bunch crossing} happens every \SI{50}{\nano\second} (2012), defining an \emph{event}. During an event, multiple pp-collisions can occur. The collision containing the vertex with the highest energy is called \emph{hard interaction}. All other collisions that do not correspond to the physics process of the hard interaction are classified as \emph{pileup}.

\section{Trigger}
Since the raw data for each event is about $\order{\SI{1}{\mega\byte}}$, the throughput required to transfer all data would be $\order{\SI{20}{\tera\byte}}$ per second. This amount of data is too much for current hard- and software, thus a selection mechanism is introduced to match the amount of recorded data to the networking, processing and storage capabilities. This system is called \emph{trigger}. The CMS trigger system consists of two layers, the "Level-1 Trigger" (L1), implemented in hardware on site, and the software "High-Level-Trigger" (HLT), located at a computing farm close to the detector. The triggers process the limited input from the detector and decide whether an event is worth storing on disk, based on physics arguments. These requirements reduce the data amount by $\order{\num{e6}}$.

\section{Event Reconstruction}
Various \emph{reconstruction} (RECO) algorithms are executed offline to reconstruct physics objects from the recorded data. The most important inputs are the bending radius of the particle tracks, energy deposits in the calorimeters and hits in the muon chambers. 
A notable algorithm that ensures that each input is linked to exactly one physics object has been developed by CMS and is called \emph{Particle-Flow}\cite{2009Particle}.
