\chapter*{Abstract}
The Model Unspecific Search in CMS (MUSiC) analyzes large amounts of CMS data by finding deviations in the kinematic distributions between the measured event yield and standard model predictions made by Monte Carlo simulations. Different from conventional dedicated analyses, MUSiC does not only focus on one or a few decay channels but covers a broad spectrum of final states which is considered. 
The calculation of the most significant deviations in the kinematic distributions is very computation intensive. This work features an additional selection step which significantly improves computation performance while keeping the same physical results.
This algorithm, called \emph{Quickscan} is motivated, introduced, tuned and validated in this thesis. The final performance gain with this procedure is about \SI{920}{\percent} and will enable the MUSiC-group to perform faster analyses in the future.
